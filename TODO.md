# TODO


---

- [ ] **Fix CurlMagic product card tag hierarchy** — Convert brand/retailer/category meta pills to plain dot-separated text. Move LIGHTWEIGHT + CGM badges to their own row. Give community tags (Holy Grail, Budget Starter etc.) a distinct style. Fix "Good Sotc" → "Good SOTC" typo in products-data.js.

- [ ] **Homepage overhaul** — Reframe messaging from "code" to AI tools broadly. Move CurlMagic (free) to top of projects list. Fix dark mode bug: white text on bright green background is invisible. Fix disorganised bottom of page. Expand lab feed beyond Finance + Consumer.


- [ ] **Rethink the shop — sell tutorials** — Shift from £5 digital products to tutorials for different use cases (non-coding gamer, busy parent etc.). MSI Claw is the natural first tutorial product.


- [ ] **Projects page — add missing projects** — Add The Agentcy (game), Zoe Recipe Finder, Acute HF EHR Pathway. Move CurlMagic to first position (currently buried 4th behind paid products). Add 2-3 spotlight projects with more detail.

- [ ] **Audit blog posts — remove unverified tool references** — post-8 (Cursor/Windsurf/Copilot, v0, Bolt/Lovable/Replit sections), post-10 (Cursor/Windsurf tool card + unverified claims), post-9 (v0 and Bolt in comparison table).




- [ ] **Create sitemap.xml** — Cover all main pages + 13 blog posts + curly-girl sub-site. Submit to Google Search Console.

- [ ] **MSI Claw mapper: blog post + push to GitHub** — claw-mapper/ is built but not pushed. Write blog post. Reference from fleet page.



- [ ] **Set up LinkedIn page for Stackless** — *(human action)* Posts 11-13 ready to repurpose immediately using Social Adapter prompt from post-13.
