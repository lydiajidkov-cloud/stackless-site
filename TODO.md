## Still To Do

- [ ] **Homepage overhaul** — CurlMagic still 4th in homepage project cards (fixed on projects page but not homepage). Messaging still narrow. Dark mode green contrast. Disorganised footer.

- [ ] **Rethink the shop** — Still sells £5 dashboards. No tutorial products yet. MSI Claw is the natural first tutorial. Different use cases for different people (gamer, busy parent etc.).

- [ ] **Set up LinkedIn page for Stackless** — *(human action)* Posts 11-13 ready to repurpose using Social Adapter prompt from post-13.

- [ ] **QA testing — guide + automation setup** — Two angles: (1) a guide post explaining what QA testing is for non-coders (why it matters, what it catches, manual vs automated), and (2) actually setting up automated tests for the Stackless site itself — e.g. Playwright or a simple link checker to catch broken links, missing pages, dark mode regressions. Could become a "Behind the Build" blog post: "How I Added QA Testing to My Site Without Being a Developer".
