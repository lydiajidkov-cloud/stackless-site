## Still To Do

- [ ] **Homepage overhaul** — CurlMagic still 4th in homepage project cards. Messaging still narrow ("code" not "AI tools"). Dark mode green contrast bug. Disorganised footer.

- [ ] **Rethink the shop** — Still sells £5 dashboards. Shift to selling tutorials for different use cases (gamer, busy parent etc.). MSI Claw is the natural first tutorial product.

- [ ] **QA testing** — Guide post explaining what QA is for non-coders + set up automated tests for the site (Playwright or link checker). Could become a Behind the Build post.

- [ ] **Set up LinkedIn page for Stackless** — *(human action)* Posts 11-13 ready to repurpose using Social Adapter prompt from post-13.
