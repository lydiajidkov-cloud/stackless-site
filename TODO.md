# TODO

- Remove duplicate "Browse Products" nav button: The nav has both a "Shop" link and a "Browse Products" CTA that go to the same page (shop/index.html). Remove the `<li><a href="shop/index.html" class="nav-cta">Browse Products</a></li>` and equivalent in each mobile menu from: index.html, about.html, projects.html, blog.html, fleet.html, resources.html, shop/index.html
