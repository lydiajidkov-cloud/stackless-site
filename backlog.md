# Stackless Backlog

## Parked Features

### AI Tools Showcase & Tutorial Hub
- **Status:** Parked (2026-02-16)
- **Trigger:** After payments (Payhip), Buy Now buttons, and deployment are done
- **Format:** Both — a `/tools` hub page linking to detailed blog posts per tool
- **First tool:** Gemini Canvas (frontend) — Lydia's current favourite
- **Concept:** Opinionated showcase of AI tools she actually uses. Practical demos, not generic reviews. Fits the Stackless brand voice (tongue-in-cheek, "I built this with AI and so can you").
- **Content per tool:** What it is, what it's good at, a real example/tutorial, her honest take
- **Revenue angle:** Could become a lead magnet or paid tutorial series later
