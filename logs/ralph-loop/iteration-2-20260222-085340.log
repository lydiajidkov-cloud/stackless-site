[LOG] Task: ## Task 1: <title>
----------------------------------------
Done. **Task 3 complete** — removed "Cursor, or similar" from `blog/post-6-security-for-non-coders.html` line 196 so it now reads "non-coders using AI tools like Claude Code who want to build things...". Committed as `2a487f7`.
