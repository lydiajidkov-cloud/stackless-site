        <h2>What is the Curly Girl Method?</h2>
        <p>The Curly Girl Method (CGM) is a hair care approach created by hairstylist Lorraine Massey and published in her 2001 book "Curly Girl: The Handbook". Massey grew up in England and was ridiculed for her curly hair. A friend later suggested washing with conditioner instead of shampoo, which transformed her approach to curl care.</p>

        <p>The core philosophy is simple: stop using ingredients that damage curls, and start working with your natural texture rather than against it. CGM is based on three steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cleanse, don't strip:</strong> Replace harsh sulphate shampoos with gentle cleansers or conditioner-only washing (co-washing). This preserves your hair's natural oils.</li>
          <li><strong>Condition generously:</strong> Use silicone-free conditioners to hydrate, detangle, and protect curls. This is the only time to comb or brush your hair.</li>
          <li><strong>Style on wet hair:</strong> Apply styling products (gels, creams, mousses) to soaking wet hair to lock in moisture and encourage curl clumping.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
        <p>CGM identifies several ingredient categories that are harmful to curly, wavy, and coily hair:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sulphates:</strong> Harsh cleansers (SLS, SLES, ALS) that strip natural oils, causing dryness, frizz, and damage to the curl pattern.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-water-soluble silicones:</strong> Coating agents (dimethicone, cyclomethicone, amodimethicone) that build up on hair, block moisture, and require sulphates to remove, creating a damaging cycle.</li>
          <li><strong>Drying alcohols:</strong> Short-chain alcohols (alcohol denat, SD alcohol, isopropyl alcohol) that evaporate quickly and wick moisture from hair.</li>
          <li><strong>Mineral oil, petrolatum, and paraffin:</strong> Petroleum-derived ingredients that coat hair and prevent moisture absorption.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Not all "bad-sounding" ingredients are actually harmful. Fatty alcohols (cetyl, cetearyl, stearyl alcohol) are moisturising. Water-soluble silicones (those with PEG/PPG prefixes) wash out easily. Behentrimonium methosulfate is a conditioning agent, not a sulphate.</p>

        <h2>Modified CGM</h2>
        <p>Strict CGM is not for everyone, and the community increasingly embraces a modified approach:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Occasional gentle sulphates for fine or wavy hair prone to buildup</li>
          <li>A clarifying wash every 4-8 weeks to reset</li>
          <li>Drying alcohols in trace amounts (last 5 ingredients) are less concerning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The philosophy is: "If it works for your hair, go ahead." The goal is healthy, happy curls, not perfect rule-following.</p>

        <h2>The Transition Period</h2>
        <p>When you start CGM, your hair may actually look worse before it looks better. This is normal. Your hair needs time to adjust to gentler products and recover from years of sulphate and silicone use.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weeks 1-2:</strong> Hair may feel oily, limp, or awkward</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 2-4:</strong> More frizz, itchy scalp possible, still adjusting</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 4-6:</strong> Hair starting to respond, mostly a learning curve</li>
          <li><strong>Months 2-6:</strong> Significant improvement, better understanding of what works</li>
          <li><strong>6+ months:</strong> Hair health noticeably improved, routine established</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Commit to at least 6 weeks before judging your results. Take monthly progress photos rather than daily ones.</p>

        <h2>Common Myths</h2>

        <div class="myth-card">
          <div class="myth-label">Myth</div>
          <p>"Sulphate-free means it's Curly Girl approved."</p>
          <div class="truth-label">Truth</div>
          <p>A product can be sulphate-free but still contain non-water-soluble silicones, drying alcohols, or mineral oil. Always check the full ingredient list.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myth-card">
          <div class="myth-label">Myth</div>
          <p>"All silicones are bad for curly hair."</p>
          <div class="truth-label">Truth</div>
          <p>Water-soluble silicones (those with PEG or PPG prefixes) wash out with gentle cleansers and do not cause buildup. Only non-water-soluble silicones are problematic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myth-card">
          <div class="myth-label">Myth</div>
          <p>"All alcohols damage hair."</p>
          <div class="truth-label">Truth</div>
          <p>Fatty alcohols (cetyl, cetearyl, stearyl, behenyl alcohol) are actually moisturising and conditioning. Only short-chain "drying" alcohols (denat, SD, isopropyl) are harmful.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myth-card">
          <div class="myth-label">Myth</div>
          <p>"You can never use shampoo on CGM."</p>
          <div class="truth-label">Truth</div>
          <p>CGM uses sulphate-free shampoos (low-poo) and recommends a clarifying wash every 4-8 weeks. The method avoids harsh sulphates, not all shampoo.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myth-card">
          <div class="myth-label">Myth</div>
          <p>"Expensive products give better results."</p>
          <div class="truth-label">Truth</div>
          <p>Some of the UK curly community's favourite products cost under &pound;1. Boots Essentials Gel (99p) and XHC Banana Conditioner (&pound;1) are holy grail staples. Technique matters more than price.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myth-card">
          <div class="myth-label">Myth</div>
          <p>"CGM works the same for everyone."</p>
          <div class="truth-label">Truth</div>
          <p>Hair porosity, density, strand width, scalp type, and your local water hardness all affect what works. Wavies (Type 2) need much lighter products than curlies (Type 3-4). What works for one person may not work for you.</p>

        <h2>The Science Behind CGM</h2>

        <h3>Why Curly Hair Is Drier</h3>
        <p>Sebum (your scalp's natural oil) is produced at the root and needs to travel down the hair shaft to moisturise it. On straight hair, sebum slides smoothly from root to tip. On curly hair, every bend and twist acts as a roadblock: the oil pools near the scalp and barely reaches the mid-lengths or ends. The curlier the hair, the worse this problem. This is a structural reality, not a flaw. It is why curly hair needs external moisture from conditioners and leave-ins.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Porosity</h3>
        <p>Porosity is how well your hair absorbs and retains moisture, determined by the condition of the outer cuticle layer. Low porosity hair has tightly packed cuticles: water beads on the surface, products sit on top, and it takes ages to dry. High porosity hair has gaps in the cuticle: moisture rushes in but leaks out just as fast. Medium porosity is the sweet spot.</p>
        <p>Genetics set your baseline porosity, but damage (heat, colour, bleaching) can only raise it. Products can temporarily smooth cuticles, but they cannot rebuild missing layers. The popular "float test" is unreliable: instead, observe how quickly your hair absorbs water and how long moisture lasts after conditioning.</p>

        <h3>Protein-Moisture Balance</h3>
        <p>Hair is 85-90% keratin protein. When the protein structure is intact, hair is strong and elastic. When it is damaged, gaps appear. "Protein treatments" temporarily fill those gaps. "Moisture treatments" hydrate the interior.</p>
        <p>Too much protein makes hair stiff and brittle. Too much moisture makes it limp and stretchy. The wet strand test: gently pull a wet strand. If it stretches and bounces back, the balance is right. If it snaps, you need moisture. If it stretches like gum without returning, you need protein.</p>

        <h3>Hard Water (A UK Problem)</h3>
        <p>Over 60% of the UK has hard water. Mineral deposits (calcium, magnesium) build up on hair over time, blocking moisture absorption and making products less effective. Signs: hair feels waxy or straw-like, curls go limp, products that used to work stop working. Solutions: monthly chelating/clarifying shampoo, shower filter, or apple cider vinegar rinses (1 tablespoon ACV in 500ml water).</p>

        <h3>Wavy Hair Is Not "Failed Curly Hair"</h3>
        <p>Wavy hair (Type 2) has its own needs, distinct from curly and coily types. Wavies have gentler bends, so natural oils travel further (less dryness), but heavy products weigh waves down and pull them straight. The biggest mistakes wavies make: using products designed for tight curls (too heavy), co-washing when their scalp needs a gentle shampoo, and applying too much product. Less is usually more for wavies.</p>

        <h2>Why UK-Focused?</h2>
        <p>Almost all CGM content and resources lean toward American products and terminology. UK users face challenges finding alternatives to recommended US products, translating brand names, dealing with different availability and pricing, and navigating fewer UK-specific communities. US content also rarely mentions hard water (a major UK issue) or budget retailers like Poundland, Savers, and Pak's.</p>
        <p>This tool is built specifically for the UK curly and wavy community, with product suggestions from Boots, Superdrug, Poundland, Savers, Pak's, Lidl, Aldi, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Amazon UK, and specialist online retailers like Only Curls and Curlsmith. All prices in GBP.</p>

        <h2>About This Tool</h2>
        <p>Curly Girl Wavy Girl UK is a free hair quiz and ingredient checker built by <a href="../index.html">Stackless</a>. It covers wavy (Type 2), curly (Type 3), and coily (Type 4) hair equally, using a database of 200+ ingredients cross-referenced against multiple CGM community sources, including CurlsBot, British Curlies, and community-verified product lists.</p>
        <p>The ingredient database includes pattern-matching rules to catch unlisted ingredients based on known naming conventions (e.g., anything ending in "-cone" without PEG/PPG is flagged as a non-water-soluble silicone).</p>
        <p>All data is processed locally in your browser. Nothing is sent to any server. Your quiz results are saved in your browser's localStorage.</p>
