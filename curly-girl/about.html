        <h2>What is the Curly Girl Method?</h2>
        <p>The Curly Girl Method (CGM) is a hair care approach created by hairstylist Lorraine Massey and published in her 2001 book "Curly Girl: The Handbook". Massey grew up in England and was ridiculed for her curly hair. A friend later suggested washing with conditioner instead of shampoo, which transformed her approach to curl care.</p>
        <p>The core philosophy is simple: stop using ingredients that damage curls, and start working with your natural texture rather than against it. CGM is based on three steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Cleanse, don't strip:</strong> Replace harsh sulphate shampoos with gentle cleansers or conditioner-only washing (co-washing).</li>
          <li><strong>Condition generously:</strong> Use silicone-free conditioners to hydrate, detangle, and protect curls.</li>
          <li><strong>Style on wet hair:</strong> Apply styling products to soaking wet hair to lock in moisture and encourage curl clumping.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>What to Avoid</h2>
        <p>CGM identifies several ingredient categories that are harmful to curly, wavy, and coily hair:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sulphates:</strong> Harsh cleansers (SLS, SLES, ALS) that strip natural oils.</li>
          <li><strong>Non-water-soluble silicones:</strong> Coating agents (dimethicone, cyclomethicone) that build up and block moisture.</li>
          <li><strong>Drying alcohols:</strong> Short-chain alcohols (alcohol denat, SD alcohol, isopropyl alcohol) that wick moisture.</li>
          <li><strong>Mineral oil, petrolatum, and paraffin:</strong> Petroleum-derived ingredients that coat hair.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Not all "bad-sounding" ingredients are actually harmful. Fatty alcohols (cetyl, cetearyl, stearyl alcohol) are moisturising. Water-soluble silicones wash out easily. Behentrimonium methosulfate is a conditioning agent, not a sulphate.</p>

        <h2>Modified CGM</h2>
        <p>Strict CGM is not for everyone. The community increasingly embraces a modified approach:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Occasional gentle sulphates for fine or wavy hair prone to buildup</li>
          <li>A clarifying wash every 4-8 weeks to reset</li>
          <li>Drying alcohols in trace amounts (last 5 ingredients) are less concerning</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The philosophy is: "If it works for your hair, go ahead." The goal is healthy, happy curls, not perfect rule-following.</p>

        <h2>The Transition Period</h2>
        <p>When you start CGM, your hair may actually look worse before it looks better. This is normal.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Weeks 1-2:</strong> Hair may feel oily, limp, or awkward</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 2-4:</strong> More frizz, itchy scalp possible, still adjusting</li>
          <li><strong>Weeks 4-6:</strong> Hair starting to respond</li>
          <li><strong>Months 2-6:</strong> Significant improvement</li>
          <li><strong>6+ months:</strong> Hair health noticeably improved, routine established</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Commit to at least 6 weeks before judging your results.</p>

          <div class="truth-label">Truth</div>
          <p>Hair porosity, density, strand width, scalp type, and water hardness all affect what works. Wavies need much lighter products than curlies.</p>

        <h2>The Science Behind CGM</h2>

        <h3>Why Curly Hair Is Drier</h3>
        <p>Sebum is produced at the root and needs to travel down the hair shaft. On straight hair, it slides smoothly. On curly hair, every bend acts as a roadblock. This is why curly hair needs external moisture from conditioners and leave-ins.</p>

        <h3>Understanding Porosity</h3>
        <p>Porosity is how well your hair absorbs and retains moisture. Low porosity has tightly packed cuticles. High porosity has gaps. Genetics set your baseline, but damage can only raise it.</p>

        <h3>Protein-Moisture Balance</h3>
        <p>Hair is 85-90% keratin protein. Too much protein makes hair stiff and brittle. Too much moisture makes it limp and stretchy. The wet strand test tells you which you need.</p>

        <h3>Hard Water (A UK Problem)</h3>
        <p>Over 60% of the UK has hard water. Mineral deposits build up on hair, blocking moisture absorption. Solutions: chelating shampoo, shower filter, or apple cider vinegar rinses.</p>

        <h3>Wavy Hair Is Not "Failed Curly Hair"</h3>
        <p>Wavy hair (Type 2) has its own needs. Less dryness, but heavy products weigh waves down. Less is usually more for wavies.</p>
