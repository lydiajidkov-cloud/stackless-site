---

## Current Content Inventory

---

## Series Concepts (ready to build)

### Series A: The Non-Expert Series (posts 11-13 done — expand this)
Good search surface. Low competition. Matches Stackless brand voice exactly.

**Done:**
- Privacy for Non-Coders: What Stays Local, What Doesn't
- Building Agent Teams: How I Use Multiple AIs Together
- The Content Creator Agent: Your AI Writing Team for £0

**Next 5 posts:**
- Post 14: Security for Non-Coders: What Actually Happens When You Get Hacked (phishing, credential stuffing, what hackers do first — demystify the threat, not the defence)
- Post 15: Prompting for Non-Coders: How to Get Consistently Good Outputs
- Post 16: Git for Non-Coders: Why You Need Version Control Even If You Don't Code
- Post 17: APIs for Non-Coders: What They Are, Why They Matter, and When to Use One
- Post 18: Local AI for Non-Coders: Running Models on Your Own Machine

### Series B: Behind the Build
Documentation of how specific Stackless products were built. Good for SEO (people searching for how to build X). Doubles as social proof.

**Post ideas:**
- How I Built a 330-Product Database Overnight (CurlMagic UK)
- How I Shipped a Finance Dashboard in 6 Hours (Family Finance)
- How I Built a Game Without Writing Any Game Code (The Agentcy)
- How I Run an AI Company as a Team of One

### Series C: The Honest AI Review
"I used X for 30 days. Here's what actually happened." Real-world usage, not benchmarks.

**Post ideas:**
- 30 Days of Claude Code: What I Built, What Broke, What I Learned
- Gemini vs Claude for Non-Coders: I Used Both for a Month
- I Tried Every AI Writing Tool. Here's What Actually Works.

### Series D: Niche Problem Solving
Long-tail SEO. Specific, searchable, practical.

**Post ideas:**
- How to Use AI for NHS/Healthcare Note-Taking (without breaking information governance)
- Building Tools for a Domain You Know Nothing About
- AI for Researchers: How to Synthesise Papers Without Hallucinating
- Running Multiple AI Projects Simultaneously: Context Management in Practice

## SEO Opportunities

### High-value search terms (low competition)
- "non-coder builds software" / "non developer builds app"
- "ai tools for non programmers" / "build app without coding"
- "claude code tutorial non coder"
- "ai privacy guide" / "what data does chatgpt keep"
- "build agent team ai" / "multiple ai agents workflow"
- "content creator ai workflow" / "ai blog writing system"

### Existing posts to optimise
- Post-6 (security): Target "AI security tips for beginners"
- Post-8 (toolkit): Target "best AI tools for non-developers"
- Post-11 (privacy): Target "AI tools privacy guide"

---

## Social Content Strategy

### LinkedIn (primary platform)
- One post per blog post: excerpt + insight + question
- Weekly "what I built this week" updates (2-3 sentences + screenshot)
- Monthly reflection on the AI product landscape

### Twitter/X
- Thread versions of every blog post
- Real-time reactions to AI news (keep brief, add perspective)
- "shipping log" style updates when releasing things

### Content repurposing flow
Blog post → LinkedIn post + Twitter thread + email subject lines (automated via Agent 5 from post-13)

---

## Product-Content Alignment

| Product | Supporting Content Needed |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Finance Dashboard | "I built a personal finance dashboard with AI" post, privacy considerations post |
| AI Portfolio | "Building an AI portfolio page" post, personal branding with AI series |
| Grocery Dashboard | Companion post on building spending trackers |
| CurlMagic UK | Already has FAQ + listen pages; could add "how I built the ingredient scanner" post |
| The Agentcy (game) | "Building a business sim without writing game code" post |
| Clinformatix | Healthcare AI content (separate brand, different audience) |

---

## Content Operations

### Production system (using the Content Creator Agent team from post-13)
1. Topic → Researcher agent (find angles, statistics, examples)
2. Researcher output → Outliner agent (structure)
3. Outline → Writer agent (draft, Stackless voice brief)
4. Draft → Reviewer agent (check against brief)
5. Final → Social Adapter agent (LinkedIn, Twitter, email subjects)
6. Manual review + personal examples added
7. Publish

### Target cadence
- 1 blog post per week (realistic with the agent team)
- 1 social post per blog post
- 1 weekly Twitter thread (from existing posts)

### Quality checklist (per post)
- Does it have a concrete, testable claim in the title?
- Does the opening sentence make the reader want to continue?
- Does every section have at least one specific example?
- Does the conclusion give the reader one clear next action?
- Is the reading time accurate?
- Dark mode compatible? Nav correct?
